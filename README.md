# GamePad

A series of games and applications using a Novation Launchpad


## How to use it

Each game can be executed by calling the script directly from its folder (e.g. `python tron/tron_game.py`)

Additionally, there is a menu to select the game: `python play.py`.
This script waits for an input to select a game.

## Games

- **Asteroids**: Pilot a spaceship and dodge all asteroids

- **Simon**: The classical game to memorize color sequences, but extra difficult

- **Tower**: Build the tower up to the top

- **Tron**: Ride the tron bikes to kill the opponent (multiplayer game)

- **Step Sequencer**: A classical step sequencer to make some Acid Techno (not really a game, but fun anyway). Recommended: use the companion Ableton Live project.
